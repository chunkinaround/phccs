# PHCCS

This is a hardcore community service script made by me, sweaty bill (#1515124). It is designed to work for people who are me, sweaty bill (#1515124).

If you aren't me, it may not work for you! It assumes you own a lot of things, and that you're whitelisted to `Alliance From Heck` and `Hobopolis Vacation Home`. For players not blessed with a whitelist to those clans, set the properties `phccs_mainClan` and `phccs_elfClan` to a clan that has a full VIP room, and a clan that has an available Mother Slime, respectively.

Requirements detailed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15MuMGxkg_9X-hTW6uFcu1G4dg-JmMYI3ON7i7aq1V1g/). Not guaranteed to be accurate. One particular note I'd like to make here is that just because something is a hard requirement doesn't mean it would be particularly difficult to cut--Iunion Crown and Retrospecs are hard requirements because the outfit code will shut down if they aren't there, but you can locally remove them (or, better yet, put in a PR) without meaningfully impacting performance. I also have not detailed non-IotM perm requirements, because it is very difficult to do; if you or someone you love regexes the code, and does a bunch of math to figure out passives, let me know and I'll list them as requirements! But until then, assume that if something is conceivably useful in CS, you should perm it.
